You use an enumeration or an enum to define a restricted set of values.

The following code defines an enumeration for a thread state.

enum State {
    case Inactive
    case Active
    case Hibernate
    case Terminated
}

var machineState = State.Inactive

machineState == State.Inactive ?  println("Inactive") : println("State Unknown")




 

Example
To define an enumeration for the alphabet while keeping track of the position of each letter in the alphabet, use the code as follows.

enum Alphabet:Int{
    case A = 1
    case B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I
    case J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q
    case R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
}
To add the integer value of A to the integer value of B, use the code as follows.

let result = Alphabet.A.toRaw() + Alphabet.B.toRaw()
