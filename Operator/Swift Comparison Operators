We use comparison operators to compare two values. We can test for equality or whether one value is greater or less than another value.

The following code describes the comparison operators available in Swift.

Operator	Description
x == y	Equal to
x != y	Not equal to
x > y	Greater than
x >=y	Greater than or equal to
x < y	Less than
x <= y	Less than or equal to
x === y	Two objects are equal
x !== y	Two objects are not equal



 

Example
Comparison operators return a boolean result that you can store in a boolean variable or constant.

The following code shows how to use Comparison Operators.

let x = 100
let y = 200

//Returns true
let b1 = x < y

//Returns false
let b2 = x == y
Comparison operators are often used with if statements to control program flow.




 

Ternary Conditional Operator
Ternary conditional operator evaluates a condition and then do one of two things based on the result of the condition.

The ternary conditional operator is written like this: condition ? action1 : action2.

The condition is an expression that returns a boolean true or false.

If the condition returns true, then the first action takes place. If the condition returns false, then the second action takes place.

The following code shows how to use Ternary Conditional Operator.

let a = 5
a == 5 ? "We're good" : "Oops, not quite"
