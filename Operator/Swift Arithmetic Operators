You use the arithmetic operators to do addition +, subtraction -, multiplication *, and division /.

The following code shows how to use Arithmetic Operators.

let a1 = 1 + 2
let a2 = 3 - 1
let a3 = 6 * 5
let a4 = 12 / 3
All of the examples in the code above result in integer output.

If one of the values is a Float or Double data type, then the result will be a floating-point data type as well.




 

Remainder Operator
To get the remainder part of the result, you can use the remainder operator %.

The following code shows how to use Division and Remainder Operators

let r5 = 13 / 3
let r6 = 13 % 3

Increment and Decrement Operators
The unary increment operator ++ and the unary decrement operator -- increase or decrease the value of a number by 1.

The following code show show to use unary plus ++.

var a1 = 5

a1 //Returns 5
++a1 //Returns 6
a1++ //Returns 6
a1 //Returns 7
In the code above we increment with the ++ as a suffix, you still get the original value reported.




 

Compound Operators
Arithmetic operators can be combined with the assignment operator to perform an arithmetic function and assign the result to the value.

var i = 0 //Declare and assign i integer equal to 0
i+=4      //Add 4 to i and assign result back to i
i*=2      //Multiple i by 2 and assign result back to i
String Concatenation
The addition operator + is also used to add strings and characters together.

let s1 = "Hello"
let s2 = "World"
let s3 = s1 + " " + s2 + "!"
