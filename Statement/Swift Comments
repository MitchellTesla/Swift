We use code comments to add information to our code.

With Swift, you can add a one-line code comment, multiple-line code comments, and nested code comments.

One-Line Code Comments
Use the double backslashes // to start a one-line code comment.

//One line code comment
You can fill up one line with these types of comments.

Multiline Comments
A multiline comment starts the comment with a backslash and asterisk /*, write the comment, and end it with an asterisk and backslash */.

/*
   Multiple line code comment
   Use this when you need to provide more detail
*/




 

Nested Code Comments
Swift supports nested comments.

        /*
        /*
        Define a and b constants
        */

        let a = 1
        let b = 2

        /*
        Define c and d constants
        */

        let c = 3
        let d = 4
        */
In the code above the last comments is nested comments
