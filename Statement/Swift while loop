while loops work by evaluating a condition and executing code as long as the condition is true.

You write a while loop by including the while keyword followed by the condition and the code block to execute.

Example
var i = 1

while i <= 10{
    println("i = \(i)")
    i++
}
The code above generates the following result.





 

do-while Loop
The do-while loop will execute the code in the block before evaluating the condition.

Use this loop when you want to make sure that code executes at least one time.

do{
   println("i = \(i)")
   i++
}while i <= 10
