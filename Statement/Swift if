if statements are used to make a choice to execute code based on the result of a comparison expression.

if (1 < 2){
   println("This is true")
}
In the code above if 1 is less than 2, then execute the code that will print out the string "That is true" to the console log.

else Keyword
You can also define an alternate action with the else keyword.

You execute either one of two actions based on the results of the expression.

if (1 < 2){
    println("That is true")
} else {
    println("Not true")
}
The code above will print out the text "That is true" to the console log since 1 is always less than 2.

The following code shows how to use Nested if Statements.

if (1 > 2){
    println("True")
} else {
    if (3 > 4){
        println("True")
    } else {
        println("Not True")
    }
}
