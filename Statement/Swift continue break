continue Statement
continue statement stops code execution and return to the beginning of the loop's code block.

for i in 1...10 {
    if (i >=4 && i <= 7){
        continue
    }
    println(i)
}
The code above generates the following result.


The numbers 4 through 7 are not printed because of the continue statement.




 

break Statement
break statement completely interrupts the execution of a loop.

for i in 1...10 {
    if (i >=4 && i <= 7){
        break
    }
    println(i)
}

The code above generates the following result.


You can use break statements in switch statements.




 

Labeled Statements
You can use the break continue , and fallthrough control statements with labeled statements.

outerloop: for x in 1...3 {
    innerloop: for y in 1...3 {
        if y == 2{
            continue outerloop
        }
        println("x = \(x), y = \(y)")
    }
}
