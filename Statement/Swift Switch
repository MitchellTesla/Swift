switch statements are used to execute code based on the value of a variable.

Example
var shape = 1

switch shape {
    case 0:
        println("0")
    
    case 1:
        println("1")
    default:
        println("No Shape Specified")

}




 

break from switch
When the break statement is reached, program control leaves the switch statement and resumes at the end right after the ending curly brace }.

let x = 6

switch x {

case 0...5:
    println("0 through 5")

case 6:
    break

case 7:
    println("Value 7")

default:
    println("Default")

}
When a case condition is made, code execution stops in the switch and resumes right after the ending curly bracket }.




 

fallthrough
If you would like to code switch statements that do include this fall-through behavior, you can use the fallthrough statement.

switch x {

  case 0...5:
     println("0 through 5")
  case 6:
     fallthrough
  case 7:
     println("Value 6 or 7")
  default:
     println("Default")
}
