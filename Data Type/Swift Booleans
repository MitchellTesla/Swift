Boolean values can be either true or false.

Booleans are used to help evaluate logical expressions.

To declare a boolean value, you can assign a value immediately, or you can use the Bool data type to declare a boolean variable.

Example
var b1:Bool
let b2 = false

let alphabet = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP"
let b4 = alphabet == "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP"
The value of b4 is true because the two strings are the same.
