# Swift - MITCHELL 2021 v0.7.0
Swift is the programming language customized by Apple and introduced as Objective-C without the C.
Swift is an object-oriented language that builds upon familiar concepts from Objective-C but includes a modern, safer syntax and multiple paradigms such as object-oriented, functional, imperative, and block structured.



Swift can work with the existing Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks, which contain all the familiar classes used in modern Mac and iOS apps.




Swift provides a lot of safety in terms of

type checking,
constants for immutability,
requiring values to be initialized before use,
built-in overflow handling, and
automatic memory management.
Swift was built using the highly optimized LLVM compiler.
