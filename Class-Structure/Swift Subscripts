A subscript is a key that is used to extract a value from a collection. For example, we use the subscript in array or dictionary.

In Swift we can add subscript to our own types.

Example
The following code shows how to add subscript to Person class.

class Person {
    private var roles = ["Manager", "Coder", "Designer"]

    subscript(index: Int) -> String {
        get {
            return roles[index]
        }
        set(newValue) {
            self.roles[index] = newValue
        }
    }
}

var p = Person()
println(p[1])
p[0] = "Tester"
