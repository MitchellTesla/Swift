Type Methods
Class functions are also called as methods.

Instance methods require a type instance.

Type methods are functions that require the type (class, enumeration, or structure) to work.

To declare a type method for a class, you must use the class keyword.

class Person {
    class var species:String{
        return "Human"
    }

    class func printDescription() {
        println( "Species: \(species).")
    }
}
Person.printDescription()



 

Type Methods for Value Types
Structures and enumerations work in the same way for type methods except that you substitute the class keyword with the static keyword.

struct Rectangle {
    static var gtp = "This is a rectangle"

    static func printDescription() {
        println("Desc: \(gtp).")
    }

}

Rectangle.printDescription()
