Swift is an object-oriented language.

Swift builds upon familiar concepts from Objective-C but includes a modern, safer syntax and multiple paradigms such as object-oriented, functional, imperative, and block structured.

Swift is a programming language customized by Apple and introduced as Objective-C without the C.

Swift can work with the existing Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks, which contain all the familiar classes used in modern Mac and iOS apps.

Swift provides a lot of safety in terms of

type checking,
constants for immutability,
requiring values to be initialized before use,
built-in overflow handling, and
automatic memory management.
Swift was built using the highly optimized LLVM compiler.





Constants
The following code creates a constant and stores the string "Hello World" in a constant named s1.

let s1:String = "Hello World"
The first part of the constant declaration is the let keyword.

The let keyword is used to define a constant.

The next part is the constant name s1.

You also have the type declaration :String.

Variables
Variables use the var keyword instead of the let keyword to declare.

Variable values can change.

var s2:String = "Hello World"
s2 = "Hola Mundo"
